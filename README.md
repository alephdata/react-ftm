# React-ftm

***

**November 2022: react-ftm has been deprecated and will not receive any further updates. As a small team with limited resources, we are unfortunately unable to continue react-ftm as a standalone library.**

***

`React-ftm` contains React components for the display, visualisation and
editing of [FollowTheMoney](https://docs.alephdata.org/developers/followthemoney)
entities. This includes:

* A network visualisation and editing tool
* A table-based entity editor for quick entry
* Display and editing components for each FtM property type

`react-ftm` is used by `aleph-ui` and `datadesktop`, and can be re-used by
other application aimed to attractively render FtM data in a browser.

### Installation 

`npm install @alephdata/react-ftm`
